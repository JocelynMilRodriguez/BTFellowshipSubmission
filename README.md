## 2020 Breakthrough Tech Fellowship - Jocelyn M. Rodriguez Submission

Thank you for taking the time to review my github repo for the Breakthrough Tech Fellowship opportunity. I have included two different projects, written in two different langauges that illustrate my developer skills and my creative expression of programming challanges given, albeit at a novice level. I hope you like my work and would appreciate any feedback you may have now or in the future.
